ANCS and NUS project for nRF51822 and iOS
==================

This project contains code examples that show how to combine the ANCS example from the SDK with a custom service.
The custom service is ble_nus from the ble_app_uart project.  
   
The iOS app is a modified version of the nRF UART App.
 
Requirements
------------
- nRF51 SDK version 5.2.0
- nRF51822 Development Kit version 2.1.0 or later

The project may need modifications to work with other versions or other boards. 

To compile it, clone the repository in the \nrf51822\Board\nrf6310\s110\experimental folder.

About this project
------------------
This application is one of several applications that has been built by the support team at Nordic Semiconductor, as a demo of some particular feature or use case. It has not necessarily been thoroughly tested, so there might be unknown issues. It is hence provided as-is, without any warranty. 

However, in the hope that it still may be useful also for others than the ones we initially wrote it for, we've chosen to distribute it here on GitHub. 

The application is built to be used with the official nRF51 SDK, that can be downloaded from https://www.nordicsemi.no, provided you have a product key for one of our kits.

Please post any questions about this project on https://devzone.nordicsemi.com.
